##Additional, we extend it to two dimensional. x, x and y
# Instead of moving, left and right, x+1, x -1, y - 1, y + 1
# Initial position - 4, 4
# Is there water at position (5, 4) -> yes
# Is there water at position (6, 4) -> no
# (3, 4) -> no
# (4, 5) -> no
# (4, 3) -> no
#Finish for tomorrow's lesson - advanced 2D plane
